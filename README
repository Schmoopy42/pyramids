The goal of this project for me is to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented concepts by trying to create various games from Pyramid Arcade (made by Looney Labs) using Python.

Also, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn react.js

Currently working on hijinks - original Looney Labs game here: https://www.looneylabs.com/games/pink-hijinks

Eventually, I'd like to make some general libraries with the pieces and components that are used in various Pyramid Arcade games: https://www.looneylabs.com/games/pyramid-arcade
